# Quantum Machine Learning with Transfer Learning and qReLU

## Overview
This project explores **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)** using **Transfer Learning** and **Quantum Rectified Linear Unit (qReLU)**. It combines quantum computing principles with classical machine learning to improve efficiency and accuracy in deep learning models.

## Features
- **Transfer Learning** applied to quantum neural networks
- Implementation of **qReLU** as an activation function
- Classical vs. Quantum performance comparison
- **Extensive documentation** for reproducibility
